## Business Problem
About Business Context

Simba Supermarket is an online and physical retail company operating even in the e-commerce industry.
The sales and operations department relies on transactional data to track customer orders, product demand, and overall sales performance.

 Data Challenge

Although Simba Supermarket records: all customer orders, management does not have a clear view of all booked products, the most purchased products and some time a customer may even order a products that are not even present in stock, or the customers who place the highest number of orders.this result in hardy to monitor sales performance,bad reputation and recognition issue to customers...

Expected Outcome

My goal for this showings is to identify all booked products to avoid more booking on same product which destroy reputatios. determine the most frequently purchased products for better inventory management and recognize customers for sales boosting.
